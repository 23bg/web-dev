              Clay can replace your prospecting, data enrichment, and AI message
              drafting tools. We don&apos;t replace email sending tools or CRMs
              (we integrate with them!) Many people run successful campaigns
              using just Clay, an email sending tool, and a CRM. You can
              continue to use any tools you have subscriptions to in Clay.

              compared to relying on just one tool. Use AI to scrape websites,
              do unstructured research that previously required SDRs, and draft
              messages. Teams commonly also use Clay to automate outbound lead
              generation campaigns, CRM enrichment, inbound lead scoring and
              outreach, and more.
